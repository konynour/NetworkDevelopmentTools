# ARP Spoofing Attack

## üìå Overview
This project is a Python script that performs an **ARP Spoofing Attack** using the `scapy` library. The attack manipulates the ARP tables of a victim and a router, allowing the attacker to intercept network traffic. This script is designed for educational and ethical hacking purposes only.

**This tool is for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of ARP spoofing is illegal and unethical. The author does not take responsibility for any misuse of this script.**

## üöÄ Features
- Retrieves MAC addresses using ARP requests.
- Spoofs ARP tables to intercept traffic.
- Restores the ARP tables after attack termination.
- Runs continuously until manually stopped.

## üìÇ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `scapy` library
